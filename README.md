 ### - I Learned How to Choose the Right Chart for The Data ?
   ### * I learned from those articles :

### -----------
   ### * I take the decision in the following 5 situations :
   #### - First : The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the entire year. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year. ( The Answer is : A line chart )
   #### - Second : The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, as a subcomponent, they would also like to see which products are contributing to the total revenue being generated by each country. ( The Answer is : A stacked bar chart )
   #### - Third : The CEO of the online retail store wants to see how much average revenue is generated by each country. They are interested in viewing the following metrics on the visual:Minimum value,First quartile value,Median value ,Third quartile value and Maximum value. ( The Answer is : A Boxplot )
   #### - Forth : The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. They are interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products. ( The Answer is : A Column Chart )
   #### - Fifth : The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. They want to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, they will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. ( The Answer is : A map chart )
